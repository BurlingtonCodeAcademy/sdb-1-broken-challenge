# Week One Broken App Challenge

## Objective

Great work on successful week one! We'll wrap it up by practicing our debugging skills.

I tasked some random developer to build my portfolio. Unfortunately, the developer working on it broke it. You are now tasked with finding all **nine** bugs scattered throughout `index.html` and `style.css` files.

Be vigilant! A lot of the bugs may be subtle and difficult to spot. If you get stuck, ask your classmate to lend another set of eyes.

## Screenshots

Below you will find desktop and mobile views of the app before bugs ate pieces of the code. The goal is to bring the site back to look identical to those screenshots.

Happy hunting!
